Current phase of plan: **Solution Design**

You now need to orchestrate the solution design agent. It will be responsible for creating the technical design and architecture plan based on the gathered context.

Once it's complete ensure that it has:
- Updated the plan with technical design artifacts
- Created implementation checklist with specific tasks
- Documented architecture decisions and file changes needed
- Marked the solution_design phase as complete
- Prepared detailed plan for the implementation phase

The agent should focus on design and planning, not actual code implementation.
