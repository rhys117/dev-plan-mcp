Current phase of plan: **Scope Analysis**

You now need to orchestrate the scope analysis agent. It will be responsible for analyzing requirements, classifying task complexity (micro/small/medium/large/epic), and decomposing large features into subtasks.

Once it's complete ensure that it has:
- Updated the plan with complexity analysis findings
- Created subtasks if the feature is large/epic
- Marked the scope_analysis phase as complete
- Documented size classification reasoning

The agent should focus on analysis and decomposition, not implementation.
