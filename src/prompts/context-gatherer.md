Current phase of plan: **Context Gathering**

You now need to orchestrate the context gathering agent. It will be responsible for exploring the codebase, understanding existing patterns, and collecting relevant context for the implementation.

Once it's complete ensure that it has:
- Updated the plan with codebase insights and patterns found
- Documented existing similar implementations or utilities
- Identified key files, dependencies, and architecture considerations
- Marked the context_gathering phase as complete
- Prepared context for the solution design phase

The agent should focus on understanding existing code, not creating new solutions.
