Current phase of plan: **Implementation**

You now need to orchestrate the implementation agent. It will be responsible for executing the technical design by creating, modifying, and testing the actual code.

Once it's complete ensure that it has:
- Updated the plan with implementation progress and changes made
- Created/modified all necessary files according to the design
- Written or updated tests as needed
- Marked the implementation phase as complete
- Documented any deviations from the original design

The agent should focus on code execution following the established design plan.
