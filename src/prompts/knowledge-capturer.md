Current phase of plan: **Knowledge Capture**

You now need to orchestrate the knowledge capture agent. It will be responsible for extracting learnings, patterns, and insights from the completed work for future reference.

Once it's complete ensure that it has:
- Updated the plan with key learnings and insights
- Documented patterns that can be reused in future work
- Captured any technical decisions and their rationale
- Marked the knowledge_capture phase as complete
- Stored insights in a format useful for future similar tasks

The agent should focus on learning extraction and pattern documentation, not code changes.
