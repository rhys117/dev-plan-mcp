Current phase of plan: **Documentation**

You now need to orchestrate the documentation agent. It will be responsible for creating user-facing documentation, updating README files, and documenting the new feature.

Once it's complete ensure that it has:
- Updated the plan with documentation files created
- Created or updated relevant documentation files
- Added usage examples and API documentation as needed
- Marked the documentation phase as complete
- Ensured documentation is clear and accessible to users

The agent should focus on creating documentation, not modifying implementation code.
